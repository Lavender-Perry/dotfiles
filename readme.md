# Dotfiles
These are configuration files for my desktop.\
You can use them with [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)

## Things configured
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (included with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
* [Doom](https://doomemacs.org/) [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

## Dependencies
These can be removed/replaced by modifying the dotfiles
* [Everything configured](#things-configured)
* [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)
  * The font is referred to as "VictorMono NF", because it is the [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) version installed through [the Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/victormononf)
  * You can install whatever version of the font you want, but you should name it "VictorMono NF"

## Other information/recommendations
* I use Windows 11, but these dotfiles should work with any version of Windows
* I install pretty much everything with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), so if a configuration doesn't work, try reinstalling the effected program from there
* I use a script created with [Privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy/) to make Windows a little less scary
* My desktop wallpaper is the [Chapter 8 complete screen](http://www.celestegame.com/images/completes/complete-8.png) from [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/)
* I use [Left-handed Windows Aero cursors](https://github.com/Microtribute/win11-aero-left-cursors) because I am left handed
